# ProjectOne

This is my first ever project, it fouces on helping
students make their academic schedules.

## How to run it?

Easily clone (or download) it and compile it using any c++ ?compiler?,
then run the program, after finsihing choosing your lectures,
you should run the python script which will add it to the .xlsx spreadsheet.
BUT you should install openpyxl module first.

```bash
pip install openpyxl
```
The program isn't finished yet, in fact there are lots of bugs,
and the final result (spredsheet) looks awful.

There should be several updates to this readme, and the project in general.
